We have been thinking about the main difficulties that new teams have, for example, once a team decides which combination of parts, or DNA composition they will use, they will need a tool, easy to use, to tell them whether or not their project is compatible with the assembly standards that are accepted. And if it’s not, which site-directed mutagenesis could avoid the restriction sites and make it compatible.
